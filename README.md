# Central Cee Website

The 'Central Cee' website is a website made for a musician called Central Cee. This was made for the user to be able to keep up to date with their favourite musician's upcoming tours, music videos and exclusive content. For the organisation or 'Central C' this is a way for the musician to have a closer bond with the users or 'music fans' as well as creating a database so he can keep in touch with his users.

## Featues 

- Navigation bar at the top of the page where I have also managed to nest my header to give the website a cleaner look. As well as this each navigation link takes you to a different page. I used white text on a black background so the text stands out along with this when hovering over the navigation links the text turns red to stay in line with the colour theme of the website.

- Input email and subscribe button allows the user to be able to subscribe to the website for exclusive content from 'Central Cee'. I added a placeholder to help the user understand what information is needed from them also as the type input is 'email' form the user will also be alerted if they entered what is deemed to be an invalid email address.

- Audio on the landing page is also available to the user and has been set on muted autoplay so the user has the choice wether they want to listen to Central Cee's music at that time or not.

- Table displaying the artist Central Cee's european tour it also includes information such as the city, venue and the date of the shows.

- Footer displaying also social media links for Central Cee. One click will open a new tab and take you to the artists social media pages. Just like the navigation bar there is a hover element which makes the text turn red when being hovered over sticking to the styling colours of the website.

- On the about page there is information which gives the user an insight in to the musician Central Cee's life.

- On the music video page theres an embedded youtube video via iframe which allows the user to stay up to date with the musicians new music videos.

- On the contact page I have added a text area form which allows theuse to write a personal message to the musician Central Cee.

## Validator Testing

HTML - I ran my html code and I had no errors using the official w3C validator

CSS - I ran my css code and I had no errors using the official jigsaw validator.

## Unfixed Bugs

- On the music video page I am still trying to play with the code and work out how I can wrap the text arround the embedded video at the moment it doesnt alow me to adjust the screen.
