# Central Cee Website

![responsive](images/responsive.png "responsive")

The 'Central Cee' website is a website made for a musician called Central Cee. This was made for the user to be able to keep up to date with their favourite musician's upcoming tours, music videos and exclusive content. For the organisation or 'Central C' this is a way for the musician to have a closer bond with the users or 'music fans' as well as creating a database so he can keep in touch with his users.

## Accessibility

## Featues 

- Navigation bar at the top of the page where I have also managed to nest my header to give the website a cleaner look. As well as this each navigation link takes you to a different page. I used white text on a black background so the text stands out along with this when hovering over the navigation links the text turns red to stay in line with the colour theme of the website.

- Input email and subscribe button allows the user to be able to subscribe to the website for exclusive content from 'Central Cee'. I added a placeholder to help the user understand what information is needed from them also as the type input is 'email' form the user will also be alerted if they entered what is deemed to be an invalid email address.

- Audio on the landing page is also available to the user and has been set on muted autoplay so the user has the choice wether they want to listen to Central Cee's music at that time or not.

- Footer displaying also social media links for Central Cee. One click will open a new tab and take you to the artists social media pages. Just like the navigation bar there is a hover element which makes the text turn red when being hovered over sticking to the styling colours of the website.
